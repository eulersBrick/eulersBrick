### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Siegfried 

...

I'm a Front-end Web-developer and Software engineer whose primary interests are in the fundamentals of computer science, be they algorithms and data structures. My passion for learning extends to all academic disciplines, but my primary interest is in computational mathematics. I enjoy competitive programming and software development. 

I have experience developing internal, offline systems, as exhibited in my most recent project for scientific instruments specialists Air-Met. I have also worked on full-scale web-apps such as the Covid-19 contact tracking web-application which my group and I completed last year. Iâ€™ve also worked on designing and implementing a server-side data compression algorithm for Maptek.
